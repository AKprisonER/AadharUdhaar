# AadharUdhaar
A cool account management app with built-in aadhar verification feature for the verification of the identity of the users.

# A Brief Description of The App
The app has 2 simple activities for borrowing and lending money to and from users. The app allows you to verify the true identity of the person to whom you are lending the money by scanning the QR code present on the AAdhar Card of that person. After scanning the QR code, you will get all the details of the person on your app. Then, you can easily manage your accounts digitally. This app can be really helpful for general store shopkeepers, canteen shops, etc. who regularly lend money to their refular customers. The app also has graph and chart visualisations to have an overview of your accounts. You can easily find the percentage of money lent or borrowed in the form a pie chart and the time for which the money has been lent or borrowed through a bar chart. The app also sends notifications if the due date of returning the money has passed. Hence, through this app you can manage all your financial accounts in a hassle-free manner on the go.
